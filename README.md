This project explores user ratings and feedback from a diverse, multilingual dataset. The goal was to go beyond simple metrics and uncover the **"why"** behind user behavior across different languages, countries, app categories, gender, and age groups.

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handling a real-world, messy dataset with missing values, inconsistent formats, and multiple languages.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Discovering trends and patterns to inform business decisions.

- **Visual Storytelling**  
  Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visualizations that communicate complex findings.

- **Actionable Insights**  
  Translating data-driven discoveries into strategic recommendations for product development and marketing.
